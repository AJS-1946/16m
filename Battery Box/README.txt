3D printed Lucas PUW7E Battery Box

This model consists of four components, the main battery box, a separately printed box side insert containing the LUCAS logo, the top of the lid and the rim of the lid. The two pieces of the lid need to be glued together once printed using super glue. The box side containing the logo also need to be glued in place in the main box.

Recommended printing material is PETG, although PLA with a high fill percentage should also give adequate strength and dimensional stability.

To finish, sand with 80 or 120 grit paper, then apply several coats of high build undercoat. Sand back using 100 - 120 grit wet-or-dry. Repeat until you get a smooth surface, then spray a couple of coats of satin or matt finish top coat. 

The battery box is designed to house two Lucas 6 volt, LSLA4-6 batteries (or similar) side by side, wired in parallel for 6v or in series for 12v.

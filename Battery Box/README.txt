3D printed Lucas PUW7E Battery Box

This model consists of four components, the main battery box, a separately printed box side insert containing the LUCAS logo, the top of the lid and the rim of the lid. Once printed, the two pieces of the lid need to be glued together using super glue. The box side containing the logo also need to be glued in place on the side of the main box.

These parts are contained in four files:

BatteryBoxBody.3mf
BatteryBoxInset.3mf
BatteryBoxLidTop.3mf
BatteryBoxRim.3mf

At the present time the logo is an approximation of the post-war Lucas logo used on the original batteries. However if I am able to achieve a sufficiently accurate reproduction of the WD battery logo I will release this as a separate inset part in the future.

Printing
Recommended printing material is PETG, although PLA with a high fill percentage should also give adequate strength and dimensional stability. The rim of the lid should be printed with an infill percentage of around 60% in order to improve the dimensional stability of the lid, other parts can be printed with an infill percentage of 15%.

After testing initial prototypes, it is also recommended that the top portion of the lid also be printed with a higher infill percentage to prevent it bowing in hot sunlight, as the top of the lid is a horizontal surface so gets the most sun, and the battery box is typically black for civilian bikes. For hot climates this could be as high as 60%, for cooler climates 30% should be adequate. Alternatively, interior vertical ribbing running along the long axis of the lid may be added.

To date, these parts have been printed using a Prusa Mk3S printer with good results, but have not been tested with other printers. If you have access to a Prusa Mk3S, Gcode files have been included for this printer

Finishing
To finish, sand with 80 or 120 grit paper to help paint to adhere to the surface, or use a furniture scraper to smooth the ridges left from 3D printing. After initial sanding, apply one or more coats of high-build undercoat, then wet-sand back using 100 - 120 grit wet-or-dry paper. Wet-sanding allows the fairly soft printed filament to sand cleanly without softening due to heat, which can result in furring of the surface. Repeat until you get a smooth surface, then spray a couple of coats of satin or matt finish top coat. 


Usage
The battery box is designed to house two Lucas 6 volt, LSLA4-6 batteries (or similar) side by side, wired in parallel for 6v or in series for 12v.

# AJS 16M components

This repository constains manufacturing information for parts I have created during the restoration of my 1946 AJS 16M 350cc motorcycle.

These components are also shared by AJS 16M models for several years after 1946, as well as by the Matchless G3L from 1941 onwards, as well as the Matchless G80.

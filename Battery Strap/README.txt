Laser cut strap to fit AJS 16M and 18M, and Matchless G3L and G80 from the 1940s.

This strap is designed to fit a Lucas PUW7E Battery or similar. If you don't have a battery that fits this shape, please see the 3D printed battery box project in this repository

The BatteryStrapOutline_mm.dxf file in this repository is a 2D path for laser cutting a battery strap, which can then be bent to suit the shape of the battery. No kerf has been deducted from this path.

Strap should be cut from 1.2mm mild steel or similar.
